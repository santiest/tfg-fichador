\chapter*{Abstract}

\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

Regulatory changes have prompted a shift in employee clock-in procedures at a facility management company, rendering many existing 
devices obsolete. A swift response was necessary, leading to the development of a cost-effective clocking device utilizing 
microcontrollers, a custom PCB, and a 3D-printed case.

This IoT device has to be responsive, intuitive to use and offer close-to uninterruped service, sending information through WiFi 
or cellular data. Data exchange is facilitated through cloud-hosted APIs developed using Java Spring, hostable as Docker containers
or as Google Cloud Functions.
